This release marks the first desktop version of ArcOS. It is built on Tauri, making it extremely small and really performant.

Before you install, a couple things are of note:

- Keyboard shortcuts can be used to interact with the ArcOS window. Currently, the only shortcut that is enabled is <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to toggle the default fullscreen mode on or off.
- Developer tools are currently disabled. We are looking to enable them in the near future, though that isn't yet definitively decided.
- You may experience bugs with the Tauri hooks to the frontend after restarting, mainly not being able to toggle Fullscreen anymore.
- The `TurnedOff` state has a piece of code in the autorun that closes the tauri application, so you won't see it.
- There is no license in the installer! Keep in mind that the entirety of ArcOS is licensed under **GPLv3**.
- The window can still be sized to a really small size, breaking the UI, because we haven't yet determined the minimum window size.
- Finally, the version number starts at `5.0.0` because this codebase is the fifth developed codebase of the ArcOS project and it's predecessors.

Please provide any feedback by [creating an issue](https://github.com/IzK-ArcOS/ArcOS-Frontend/issues/new). Any and all feedback will help us improve the project.
