Changes in this release include:

- You will now be asked to log in in the FTS
- You can now authenticate ArcTerm without having to go to the login or FTS first.
- I have begun implementing ArcTerm scripting (see `help exec`) to run script files
- Improved ArcTerm Mode startup speed: it will now bring you to the prompt as fast as the ArcAPI can respond to the required requests.
- You can now see how many ArcTerm commands are loaded by running `help --count`.
- Fixed `font-size` inconsistency in ArcTerm mode: everything is now `14px`.
- Added a lock to the desktop to prevent it from being loaded twice in one instance, which causes issues because of Svelte
- Added the `desktop` ArcTerm command to quickly switch to the desktop
- Disabled the `state` ArcTerm command
- Fixed a bug where the `logout` command caused issues with the UserData if executed after switching to ArcTerm mode from the desktop.
- Added `ArcTermStd.verbose` boolean to suppress errors and after-command whiteline; control it with `verbose --on` and `verbose --off`
- ArcTerm: User input is now also possible outside of the regular `promptLoop` using `ArcTermStd.read`
- You can now reset your local ArcOS instance from ArcTerm using `reset`. This will only clear `LocalStorage`, nothing else.
- You can now hit <kbd>F2</kbd> to restore the previous command in ArcTerm
