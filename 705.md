- Added better error handling to ArcFind

- Added drive capabilities to clearly indicate to ArcOS components what a drive can do
- Every filesystem operation in ArcOS is now try/catched to prevent unwanted crashes
- You can now copy and move files between drives! This functionality is early-stages, so files may fail to transfer, please keep in mind.
- The UI for file operations has been improved to more clearly indicate what's happening
