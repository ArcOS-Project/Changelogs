Changes in this release:

- The Tauri window title now represents the current state
- FTS no longer crashes if you try to go back from the server connect page
- The DevBar has been disabled as it was causing import conflicts
- ArcTerm Mode is back! Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> on boot to go to ArcTerm Mode. Alternatively, you can hold shift while opening the Exit menu on the desktop to show an additional ArcTerm option. Keep in mind: you can only enter ArcTerm mode if you checked "stay logged in" on the login screen, otherwise it will not be able to authenticate.
- You can now toggle ArcTerm to fullscreen by pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>
- Tauri keyboard shortcuts for reloading the page are now disabled.
- The restart option in the Exit menu will no longer remove the remembered token. The Logoff action has been reintroduced, which takes care of clearing the remembered token.
