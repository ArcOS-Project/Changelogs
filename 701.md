## A comment about ArcOS updates

First of all, updates are automatically applied to v7.izkuipers.nl once it releases, because there is no desktop app anymore. Furthermore, updates for ArcOS v7 will be a lot smaller than the big feature drops you may have been accompanied to back in the v5 and v6 days. ArcOS v7 updates will be bug fixes, minor feature drops, and overall smaller updates to reduce the burden of the release cycle.
