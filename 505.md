Changes in this release include:

- You can now use an image from your ArcFS account as wallpaper: open the image in Image Viewer, right click it and select `Set as wallpaper`.
- When there is an update available from the GitHub, you'll be notified using a push notification on login.
- The <kbd>F7</kbd> key will no longer ask if you want to enable Caret Browsing (issue because of Edge WebView)
- A new visual style was added! "Science Fiction" uses colors from Sci-Fi user interfaces.
