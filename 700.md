# It's time to open the flood gates

I've been developing ArcOS v7 since January 1st 2025. When I wrote the first lines of code I started to feel the magnitude of the months of work that laid ahead of me. Now we're over five months later, and I've written so much code to make ArcOS for everyone who may want to use it. I know better than anyone that you can't keep great stuff behind lock and key for too long, which is why:

## ArcOS v7 is now open to the public **as a beta release**! :tada:

This means that:

- There will be bugs and incomplete features
- The user interface may change in large ways until v7 is declared **stable**
- The app store still has to be created because I haven't found the best way to do that. If you have any ideas, please do let me know
- There's a massive ToDo list of things I still have to finish in order to persuade v7 into stability, and that will take time
- Documentation for ArcOS application development is being written, but it's not finished yet! However, it's complete enough to create some basic apps, [here it is](https://docs.arcapi.nl).

# v7 can be found here: https://v7.izkuipers.nl/.

> Please be sure to **give feedback** about anything that isn't right, features you're missing, or stuff you'd like to see added to the OS
