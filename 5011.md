This update brings a lot of visual changes and enhancements to ArcOS, such as rewritten Shell and login screens, one new game, and much more.

> [!WARNING]
> We unfortunately had to drop support for Firefox due to CSS limitations. This update also disables a lot of visual features on Firefox, like glass effects and animations. We are sorry for the inconvenience but we won't be bringing support for Firefox back until these limitations are resolved.

## Changes in this release

### Added/Changed Features

- ArcOS apps can now also open files based on file extensions.
- We added a new game! 2048 is now a part of ArcOS.
- Added a Home Page to the File Manager, containing pinned files/folders of your choosing.
- Introduced the Icon Library which contains all icons used by ArcOS components.
- Added the Settings App `Asterisk` indicator to provide additional information for preferences.
- **Windows**:
  - Added the `Accented` titlebar controls.
  - Colored Shell will now also affect ArcOS windows.
- **Shell**:
  - It is now possible to ungroup the start menu apps.
  - The accent colors have been updated to better lighter/darker variants for the User Interface components.
  - Updated the Taskbar clock to optionally include the Date and 12-hour clock.
  - It is now possible to position the Taskbar at the top of the screen again.
- **Personalization**:
  - You can now specify a Custom Accent Color by clicking the Edit button on the Visuals settings page.
  - You can now change the Login Background by going to the Login settings page.
  - Added the Accented Start Button: turn this on to match the Start Button to your accent color.
- **Desktop**:
  - Added a bunch of wallpapers: `img21`, `img22`, `img23`, `img24`, `img25`, `img26`, `img27` and `img28` have been added to ArcOS.
  - ArcOS Desktop Icons can now be dragged around! Simply grab an icon and relocate it to where you want it to go. You can also disable the forced grid and lock the icons to prevent their positions from changing.
- **ArcTerm**:
  - Added `sud` to allow for UserData modification from within ArcTerm.
  - Added `poke` to allow you to modify Window Properties temporarily from within ArcTerm.
  - `help` is now truncated to a minimal view by default. Use `help --list` to view all commands with their descriptions.

### Improvements

- Improved general system stability: the number of crashes should now be noticeably smaller;
- The shell has gotten a massive CSS overhaul: it now looks and functions a lot more professionally.
- Added `attentionId` which can request user attention through the taskbar buttons;
- You will no longer be asked to press a key in the desktop app;
- Implemented many performance improvements: windows will now unload its content when not opened, and the Glass Blur will only apply to focused windows.
- Replaced the `dragLogic` with `NeoDrag` to make our lives easier;
- The File Manager List View will now show the date modified of a file as well;
- All icons are now re-exported to allow for easy importing in the codebase.
- Adapted to `Writable.update` to improve performance.
- Added box shadows to several UI components to improve their appearance.
- Updated the dialogs to improve their UI.
- Replaced the themes icon with a better one.
- Updated the Launcher Mode TopBar to have more functionality.
- Updated File Manager to use a global `fbState` variable instead of multiple separate writables.
- The Login has been rewritten to improve performance and clarity.
- States no longer use a writable to store the current state, improving system stability.
- Updated the File Manager UI to feature more rounded corners and consistency.
- Updated File Manager context menus to actually make them useful.

### Bug Fixes

- ArcTerm will no longer be able to bypass the login, which resulted in a bugged state of no API connection;
- Repeatedly pressing the Solve button of the Calculator App will no longer crash ArcOS;
- Fixed a bug where `UpdateNotice` wasn't a hidden application;
- Updated the window sizing of Lights Off to respect large titlebars;
- Apps that require an ArcFile to work can no longer be opened through workarounds.
- The FTS is no longer centered using `position: absolute`.
- Added a crash lock to prevent ArcOS from sending multiple crash reports about the same thing at once.
- ArcOS will now remove the remembered token if you change servers. This didn't happen previously due to a typo.

### Removed Features

- It is no longer possible to launch ArcTerm from the `Exit` screen.

## Known Issues

- The Open With dialog crashes ArcOS when launching from the File Manager.
- The Profile Picture Selector doesn't render because of wrong import paths.
- The User Data Explorer of the Settings App doesn't have a close button or its header.

> Note: some of these issues aren't present in 5.0.11 **ESR** due to the later build time.
