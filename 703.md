- Windows can now be resized from all sides
- Added tooltips to a bunch of iconic buttons
- Fixed an overflow issue with notifications
- Tweaked the design of v7 to make it more modern
- Window glass accenting is back! It's enabled via Broad Accent Colors in settings.
- Prevented crashes when spawning several component apps irregularly (e.g. through ArcTerm and the Settings app)
- Tweaked light mode some more to improve contrast
- Locked shares will now also be locked on ::my_arcos
- The login screen now remembers the last logged in user when you log out
- I've begun trying to make ArcOS v7 usable on Safari (no promises :grimacing:)
- JS scripts in third-party apps now have actual filenames instead of `data:` URLs by proxying the file contents to the backend, this greatly improves TPA debugging
