> **NOTE**: This is a **bugfix** Release

> **Warning**: The Windows version of this release thinks it is in the browser even though it isn't. This is a known bug that will be solved in ArcOS 5.0.10.

Changes in this release include:

- Added a dedicated `Command.help` method for ArcTerm commands, this gives commands better help information;
- Fixed a bug where the `MediaPlayerApp` did not play the file immediately when opened;
- ArcTerm verbosity will now also disable the prompt (`verbose --off`);
- ArcTerm will now follow the state of custom cursors;
- Killing the ArcTerm app from ArcTerm won't crash ArcOS anymore;
- The primary system font has been changed from `Inter` to `Nunito Sans`;
- Fixed an issue where the `LoggerApp` had a blank bar at the top;
- You can now access ArcTerm mode from the First Time Setup by clicking it in the sidebar;
- ArcOS will no longer crash on `AbortError`, `NotSupportedError`, `NotAllowedError` and `AxiosError`, greatly decreasing the amount of crashes;
- Gave the `Create Report` button in `BugReports` a label to more clearly indicate it;
- The `ServerSelect` state will no longer crash ArcOS if there are no registered servers, now it will automatically redirect to the First Time Setup instead;
- Changing states from the Desktop to ArcTerm Mode will no longer discontinue the token, causing ArcOS to crash.

#### Important!

Please report any bugs you find either on the issues page of the frontend repositories **or** from the Bug Reports app in ArcOS itself.
