This update brings a lot of Quality of Life changes and bug fixes.

## Changes in this release

- Fixed a bug where the `rf` command would crash ArcOS if the file didn't exist (BugRep)
- Corrected an issue with the File Manager where it caused ArcOS to crash because of `openWithAny`
- The User Data Explorer and Profile Picture Viewer in Settings had wrong import-paths, causing them to malfunction. This has been corrected.
- Updated the Media Player height to automatically adapt to the Titlebar size
- Changed state handling from a writable to a regular variable
- ArcTerm will now use the `$version` variable instead of `${ArcOSVersion}` for new configuration files
- ArcOS will now remove your saved credentials if you delete your account
- ArcTerm: `logout` will now work on the Desktop
- We added some new wallpapers! The Computer Clan generously allowed us to add `img29`, `img30` and `img31` to ArcOS.
- FTS: The Update screen will now allow you to skip to the next version
- Windows will no longer be able to maximize if ArcOS' screen size is too small
- Fixed a bug where the File Manager would jump around to `./` when opened for the first time
- ArcOS will now crash if you're Rate Limited
- Bug Reports for connection failures have been disabled

- Added **experimental sideloading** which will allow users to add their own applications in the future
- Built-in themes now each have a login background
- Updated file downloading to properly name the download
- Updated crashing to be more reliable and consistent
- Account for sideload failing in crashes
- We added another game! Please welcome Qlorb to ArcOS. To learn how to play, select Help on the start screen.
