# ArcOS Changelogs

This repository contains an archive of changelogs for each major version of ArcOS, starting with v5.0.0, and working up to the latest release. It's also the source ArcOS v7 uses to display changelogs to the user when a new update is released. ArcOS reads the [`__REPO__`](./__REPO__) file to determine the changelogs in this repository
