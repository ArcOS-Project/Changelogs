ArcOS v6 is released! We've been hard at work creating this fresh new release of ArcOS. Everything has been rewritten from the ground up to give you the best experience possible. Here's a brief overview of what changed:

- Rewrote the ArcOS Shell
- Updated ArcTerm's commandset
- Created a new Boot Screen
- Updated the login background transitions
- Created a new First Time Setup
- Rewrote these visible apps:
  - Settings: Kept base UI, removed the collapsible sidebar, removed page transition animations, increased sidebar spacing, completely revamped all settings components
  - Logging: Complete new design, added support for arguments to open a specific part of the LogStore.
  - Processes (was Application Manager): Kept same indentation concept, completely revamped the UI.
  - Writer: Rewritten from scratch, now with more Quality-of-Life features.
  - File Manager: New design, new sidebar, new functionality, and got rid of the home page. It was terrible.
  - Markdown Viewer: Same base application, added functionality for interacting with the opened file in other applications
  - Image Viewer: Same base application, added functionality for interacting with the opened file in other applications
  - Media Player: Completely redesigned, added support for more audio types and video files. It now also has a taskbar tray popup for controlling the media anytime.
  - Messages (was Messaging App): Completely redesigned, kept double-sidebar concept, added a status bar and fully featured topbar options
- Rewrote these hidden (system) apps:
  - Desktop Wallpaper: Updated to work with the ArcOS v6 APIs
  - App Info: Redesigned and rewritten to work with PIDs
  - Error (was `ErrorDialog`): Made it more modular and better looking
  - Exit: Redesigned
  - Open With: Redesigned, kept similar design to ArcOS v5.
  - Load/Save dialog: Made it more modular, it now has options for loading, saving, starting folder, default filename and file types.
  - ArcFind: Results should now better math what you're looking for, and the results should also load in faster.
- Ported all of these applications to v6 without rewrite:
  - ArcTerm: Small command updates to work with the v6 APIs
  - Qlorb: Near-direct port, added top-score
  - Lights Off: Near-direct port, updated UI and added level transitions
  - Calculator: Direct port, no changes
  - Donut: Direct port, no changes
- Re-added Safe Mode from WebOSv3 for use in an account-threatening situation
- Added Window Snapping: right click any titlebar, and go to Window Snapping to see the snapping options.
- Redid the crash screen to provide a more user-friendly interface
- Implemented a PIDs system, allowing you to open multiple instances of the same application. Press Alt+X to view running processes. Do note that ArcOS stops permitting new processes after 150, because the DOM starts showing visual glitches beyond this point
- Added a service system for executing common tasks momentarily or constantly, depending on the usecase.
- Added the Windows 7 Aero window controls
- Removed the 2048 game because it wasn't refined enough
- Updated all built-in profille pictures to SVG variants to improve their quality
- Added predefined system folders with dedicated icons
- Added a Help & Support application for getting help about ArcOS without leaving it
- Redid the design for the Action Center
- Updated the consistency of the taskbar, start menu and action center.
- Updated light mode to better reflect your chosen accent color
- Changed the border radius of several components to favour a more modern interface
- Added a v6 indicator to the login to show when someone is using ArcOS v6. This indicator will be removed in ArcOS 6.0.1 and above. The flag for this indicator is `UserData.acc.v6`
- You can now play Video Files in the Media Player!
- Moved file loading operations from the File Manager to the corresponding application to improve application opening times
- Updated the file progress dialog to show useful information about any in-progress file operation.
- Added the Secure Context to prevent unwanted actions from happening without you knowing them about it. See the Security Menu in the System Tray, or the Security Tab in Processes (Alt+X)
- Added a refined flag system to ArcTerm commands. Commands will fail to execute if the command is malformed or required flags are missing.
- ArcOS Windows can now have option menus in the titlebar to more easily navigate through the application and perform certain operations
- It is now possible to report bugs from the First Time Setup. To do this, go to Advanced -> Submit a bug report
- You can now launch ArcTerm as a window from the First Time Setup. To do this, go to Advanced -> Launch ArcTerm.
- The First Time Setup and Boot Screen will now match your system's color scheme. If you have a light theme, these places will too be light.
- We have re-added support for Firefox. It is now considered one of the recommended browser platforms for ArcOS. **Safari will remain to be unsupported**.
- ArcOS will now ask you if you want to continue opening links. When you click on a link that goes outside of ArcOS, a dialog will appear asking you if you want to continue.
- The Git build of 6.0.0 and any future releases will now be reflected in the `/build` file. This build can be seen from various parts of ArcOS, and is also reflected in Bug Reports.
- Optimized various ported applications, components and states from opening and functioning as fast as possible. ArcTerm is a notable example, it now opens around three times faster than it did in ArcOS 5.0.12.
- Removed the Compact Start Menu from ArcOS, as nobody appeared to use it.
- Added support for various different filetypes to further streamline file operations on ArcOS v6.
- Updated system context menus to provide better options for the targeted component or application.
- Added sub-menus to context menus: Hover over a sub-menu button to view sub-items.
